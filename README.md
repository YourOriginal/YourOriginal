#  Hello Visitors and Welcome to my Github! 👋

## Who I am 

I'm Janzen Liu, a Neuroscience graduate from the University of Toronto that has found a passion for identifying solutions in data driven problems and their applications to real world scenarios. I'm currently residing in Toronto and acitvely looking for opportunities in the field.

I have found many interests and hobbies that I have been privilidged with to explore, all thanks to my parents. Piano 🎹, dance 🕺🏽, Taekwondo 🥋, cooking 👨‍🍳 and gaming 🎮 have all been things I am passionate about and have been a real life saver during the long long months of COVID.
