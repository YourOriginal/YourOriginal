#  Hello Visitors and Welcome to my Github! 👋

## Who I am 

I'm Janzen Liu, a Neuroscience graduate from the University of Toronto that has found a passion for identifying solutions in data driven problems and their applications to real world scenarios. I'm currently residing in Toronto and acitvely looking for opportunities in the field.

I have found many interests and hobbies that I have been privilidged with to explore, all thanks to my parents. Piano 🎹, dance 🕺🏽, Taekwondo 🥋, and gaming 🎮 have all been things I am passionate about and have been a real life saver during the long long months of COVID. You can even take a look on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/janzenliu/)!

Feel free to contact me at my [email](Liujanzen@gmail.com).

## Project Samples

### [Job Fraud Detection](https://github.com/Ikyupark/Capstone-project)
- Used job posting data provided from Kaggle to determine job posting legitimacy based
on various criteria
- Performed exploratory data analysis on parameters within the data set and visualized data
using Matplotlib and NLTK
- Assisted and regularly communicated in a team environment to ensure steady workflow
to meet deadlines
- Achieved a ML model that could predict fraudulent jobs with an accuracy, precision and
recall rating of > 98%

### [Credit Risk Analysis](https://github.com/YourOriginal/AI-Credit-Risk)
- Performed credit risk analysis using artificial intelligence by applying various supervised
machine learning models such as the ones found in SMOTE, sklearn, and imblearn
libraries
- Applied under-sampling, over-sampling and combination sampling to compare
performance of sampling models
- Calculated balanced accuracy scores and confusion matrixes to summarize the data post
analysis

### [Amazon Consumer Rating Analysis](https://github.com/YourOriginal/Amazon_Vine_Analysis)
- Analyzed product reviews from the “Video Games” department of Amazon to determine
biases behind product reviews
- Used PySpark to perform ETL on datasets acquired from Amazon’s databases and then
exported the data into a pgAdmin server with appropriate data frames and tables
- Filtered the data to meet certain criteria in determining the legitimacy of reviews and
provided a written overview of the project


## On-going Project

### Manim For Education

Math is a difficult subject but has gotten a bad rep as teaching methods have been limited due to technology. However, advancements and users such as 3B1B along with its great community has developed a beautiful library for math visualizations. In an effort to better improve math delivery in our education system, this on going project aims to cover vital math topics in a visually appealing manner and will be provided free to educators. (WIP, Learning)
